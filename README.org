*** Taking mild pathologies with special care.
Due to the discreteness of Poisson distribution, we need handle two mild pathologies carefully.
1. When background varies, the confident belt show abnormal structure.(see in variousBKG_gif folder).
2. This abnormal structure leads to the “jump” of mu_2(b), which is different from our expection.
We want mu2 as function of background to be non-increasing function. What we modify is ...
** How to use the program
1. In /src/single_core_version/init.jl, setting CL(confident level) and nrange.
2. Run /julia init.jl/ in the terminal.
3. Waiting until the program is done. It will generate a data file named mu1(or mu2)_bkg_...
4. Run lookItup.jl.
*Notice: If data file has existed, there is no need to run init.jl again.*
